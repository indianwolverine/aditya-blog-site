[aerc](https://aerc-mail.org/) is a terminal based mail client maintained by [Drew Devault](https://drewdevault.com/). I contribute to the project, doing basically whatever needs to be done, since it's 
still in the early stages of development. If you're interested in contributing, join the IRC channel #aerc on irc.freenode.net for end-user support, and #aerc-dev for development. The team is very friendly and patches get reviewed pretty quickly!
